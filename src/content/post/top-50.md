Top 50 lists are one of the reasons I wanted to create this website in the first place.

I genuinely enjoy connecting with people who share similar tastes.

In fact, some of my closest friendships have formed through a shared love of pop culture. Bonding with someone through
music, games, movies, or TV shows really feels natural and is a nice complement to "circumstantial" friendships - those
where you are "forced" to be physically present in the same place (school, work, etc.), but other than that don't have
much else in common.

Anyway, before I digress further, enjoy the [**Top 50 lists**](/top-50)!

... and feel free to send me a message if youâ€™re into the same stuff.
