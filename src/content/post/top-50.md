Top 50 lists are up!

This was one of the reasons I wanted to create this website in the first place.

I genuinely enjoy connecting with people who share similar tastes.

In fact, some of my closest friendships have formed through a shared love of pop culture. Bonding with someone over
music, games, movies, or TV shows feels so natural and is a nice complement to circumstantial friendships — those
where you are "forced" to be physically present in the same place (school, work, etc.), but don't have much else
in common.

Anyway, before I digress any further, enjoy the [**Top 50 lists**](/top-50)!

... and feel free to send me a message if you’re into the same stuff.
