## Homelab

Boy, it's been a while since I last posted something here. Time flies for sure, that's the bad news...
But the good news is that you are the pilot.

Anyway, I wanted to share my homelab repository that I've been working on for a while. It's a collection of
scripts, configurations, and documentation related to my homelab setup.

You can find the repository on GitHub: https://github.com/djordjeandrejevic/homelab

Feel free to explore the repository, and if you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out!
