## Homelab

Boy, it's been a while since I last posted something here. Time flies for sure, that's the bad news...
But the good news is that you are the pilot.

Anyway, I wanted to share my homelab repository that I've been working on for a while. It's a collection of
scripts, configurations, and documentation related to my homelab setup.

Hopefully it can inspire or help others who are interested in starting a new hobby or improving their existing homelab.

You can find the repository on GitHub: [**github.com/djordjeandrejevic/homelab**](https://github.com/djordjeandrejevic/homelab)

Feel free to explore the repository, and if you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out!

P.S. Credits to [r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) community, it's a great place to step into the rabbit hole of self-hosting.
