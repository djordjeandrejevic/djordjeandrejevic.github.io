    <p>Inspired by <a href="https://nirvana.fandom.com/wiki/Kurt_Cobain%27s_Top_50_Albums">Kurt Cobain's Top 50 Albums</a> list, I've decided to form my own curated lists of favorites.</p>
    <p>So, here's a collection of my personal best albums, games, movies, and television shows that shaped me as a person.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/top-50/albums">Top 50 Albums 🎸</a></li>
      <li><a href="/top-50/games">Top 50 Games 🎮</a></li>
      <li><a href="/top-50/movies-tv-shows">Top 50 Movies & TV Shows 📽️</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>Disclaimer: The list is subject to change and numbering doesn't imply ranking (for instance, the movie at number #1 isn't necessarily better than the one at number #50).</i></p>
